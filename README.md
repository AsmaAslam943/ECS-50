# ECS-50
This repository contains coding assingments for my Computer Organization & Machine-Dependent Programming course. 
The course had 6 different coding assingments, which each were equally challenging. The different languages that 
I used throughout this course included Assembly, C, and RISCx86. 

# Course Overview 
Comparative study of different hardware architectures via programming in the assembly languages of various machines. Role of system software in producing an abstract machine.

# Summary of Course Content 
1. Basic Memory Architecture
Review of ECS 40 C-language material on bits, bytes and memory addresses. Linear versus segmented address forms.
2. Introduction to Processor Architecture
Introduction to instruction sets, addressing modes and register sets, and their variation from one machine to another. Comparison of at least one CISC architecture and at least one RISC architecture, via extensive assembly-language programming on each. Memory-mapped versus separate-address-space I/O. I/O devices. Hardware interrupts. I/O programmingâ€”wait-loop, interrupt-driven, and via calls to operating system services or keyboard, video and file access.
3. The Role of System Software in Producing an Abstract Machine
Distinction between the roles of hardware and software. The use of compilers and operating systems in providing abstractions and machine independence to the programmer. Compiler implementation of C/Pascal data types, and storage allocation of variables in memory. Role of the operating system in helping the programmer to create, store and execute his/her programs, and in managing system resources.
4. Machine Capability and Speed
Transportability/nontransportability of programs on different machines, and under different operating systems and compilers. Efficiency of compiled vs. hand-coded programs. Writing mixed C-language/assembly language programs for extra efficiency or for special capabilities. Tradeoffs between the speed of hardware implementation of a function and the flexibility of software implementation.
